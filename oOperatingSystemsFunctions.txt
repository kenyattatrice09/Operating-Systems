My Windows 10 function allows me to do work at home, at work and for my business an personal use. 
Being able to use various programs and email in one place is very convenient. 
The memory makes using multiple programs easier. 
Being able to coordinate various tasks is a plus for the computer use. 
To go back into a spot I ended to add or just organize is helpful within files.
Task management is  important for me with school, work and business.
Another operating sytem function that I like with my laptop is printers and other hookups.
My printers arr compatible wth the operating system and documents are wasliy recognized.
Even when hooking the laptop up to my TV for business and social reasons, it stays in alignment and easy to use and operate.
